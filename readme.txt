This is a vanilla Hestia Theme child theme that is built to work in the CARES environment.

This theme will de-enqueue the Hestia version of Bootstrap, if the CARES Data Tools plugin has enqueued Bootstrap separately, to avoid the dreaded double bootstrapping.

CSS: Use css/style.scss if you want to use scss, then compile using Grunt, or delete the Grunt stuff and work in style.css directly.
